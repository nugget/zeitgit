# Quick-start Guide #

## Installing the receiver ##

The core of Zeitgit is the collector script which runs on a central host
and accepts commit information from developers via email.  This collector
script requires PostgreSQL and TCL on the host.  It can easily be launched
automatically via procmail, although integration into any mail delivery agent
should be a relatively straightforward process.

1. Create the database to store the Zeitgit log data and initialize the
   schema.  You'll also want to set a custom password on the committer role:

        createdb zeitgit 
	psql zeitgit < db/schema.sql
	psql zeitgit -c "ALTER ROLE committer WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'pwd';"

2. Configure the receiver script to use your local database configuration:

        cd receiver
	cp config.tcl.sample config.tcl

   Then edit config.tcl to taste.  Minimally you'll need to change the
   password to match the SQL command you ran in step 1.

3. Hook up the collector script to an email account or alias you've created.
   How this works exactly will be site-specific depending on your host
   configuration, but here's how it works for us.  There's a unix account on
   the server which receives the commit emails from the repo hooks.  That
   account has a .procmailrc that contains:

        LOGFILE=$HOME/log/procmail.log
	VERBOSE=yes
	LOGABSTRACT=all

	:0 H
	* ^Subject:.*gitcommit
	| $HOME/src/zeitgit/receiver/receiver.tcl

   This catches any incoming commit email from a Zeitgit client and pipes it
   into the receiver script, which in turn stores the commit info in the
   database.


## Installing Zeitgit on a local repository/clone ##

Zeitgit includes a shell script which can be used to automatically maintain
the git hooks and configuration.  Running "make install" from the base
zeitgit directory will install shared copies of the hook scripts and the
tool script into /usr/local/share/zeitgit/ and /usr/local/bin/ on the machine.

You'll probably want to install this on any machine which developers use such
as shared development servers and personal workstations.  You can override
the /usr/local/ pathing with command-line variables.  For example:

    make PREFIX=/opt install

This will provide a 'zeitgit' tool which can then be used in a repository to
install the related hooks and configure the Zeitgit target email address.

Change into a repo or clone directory and run:

    zeitgit enable email@example.com

To temporarily disable zeitgit you can run:

    zeitgit disable
